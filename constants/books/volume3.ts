He questions the legitimacy of authority derived from force and differentiates between natural and societal bonds, suggesting that while the family represents the first natural society, political institutions must be based on mutual consent and conventions.

Chesterton is a philosophical novel with elements of adventure and satire, written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around the enigmatic character Gabriel Syme, a police detective who infiltrates a group of anarchists in London to uncover their plans and identities. As the narrative unfolds, it explores complex themes of order, chaos, and the nature of evil, often through witty dialogue and absurd situations that challenge conventional thinking.  At the start of the novel, readers are introduced to the suburb of Saffron Park, with its colorful and eccentric inhabitants, primarily poets and artists. One evening, during a striking sunset, the anarchistic poet Lucian Gregory meets Gabriel Syme, who surprises him with bold arguments in favor of law and order, challenging Gregory's views. Their conversation escalates into a duel of ideologies when Gregory reveals his deep commitment to anarchism, which leads to a confrontation between the two. In a twist of fate, Syme's true identity as a detective is disclosed, and as he joins the anarchists disguised as one of them, the stage is set for a profound exploration of the philosophical conflict between chaos and structure in society.
